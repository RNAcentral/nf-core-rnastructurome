"""Build a 4-column BED of covered transcripts and their spliced lengths from a GTF.

Reads transcript IDs (one per line) from covered_ids.txt in the working directory and
computes each transcript's spliced length as the sum of its feature (default exon) lengths
in the GTF. Writes covered.bed as "<id>\\t0\\t<length>\\t<id>" — the 4th column keeps the
clean transcript ID so rf-rctools extract does not rename the region to <id>_0-<end>.

Usage: rctools_covered_bed.py <gtf> <feature_name> <attr_name>
