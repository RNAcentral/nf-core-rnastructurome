# nf-core/rnastructurome: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the early steps (QC, trimming, alignment) follow standard RNA-seq conventions and their outputs are described in the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/output/) documentation; this page focuses on the RNA Framework modules and downstream outputs specific to this pipeline.

## Output layout

All paths are relative to the top-level output directory specified with `--outdir`.

## Standard steps (QC, trimming, alignment)

Read QC (FastQC), adapter trimming (Cutadapt), alignment (STAR), and SAMtools post-processing follow standard nf-core/rnaseq conventions. See the [nf-core/rnaseq output documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/docs/output/) for a description of those output files.

FastQC is run twice per sample and both reports are published to `fastqc/`: once on the raw input reads (`<sample>_{1,2}_fastqc.*`) and once on the Cutadapt-trimmed reads (`<sample>_trimmed_trimmed_{1,2}_fastqc.*`), so you can compare read quality before and after trimming.

## Reference files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `reference/`
  - `ensembl_fasta_source_url.txt`: URL of the FASTA file downloaded from Ensembl, for provenance.
  - `ensembl_gtf_source_url.txt`: URL of the GTF file downloaded from Ensembl, for provenance.
  - `<organism>.sorted.fa`: Chromosome-sorted reference FASTA, ready for reuse in subsequent runs via `--fasta`.
  - `<organism>.annotation.gtf.gz`: Ensembl gene annotation GTF, ready for reuse via `--gtf`.
  - `<reference>.transcripts.fa`: Genome route with the default `count_genome = false` only. Transcript sequences extracted from the genome FASTA and GTF (via `gffread`), matching the transcript IDs used in the count/norm/fold outputs. Load this as the reference in a genome browser to view the transcript-coordinate tracks (see below).

</details>

The source-URL and `sorted.fa` / `annotation.gtf.gz` files are published only when the reference is downloaded automatically from Ensembl (i.e. `--fasta` was not provided); when a local FASTA is supplied, those are not re-published. The sorted FASTA can be passed directly to subsequent runs to skip the download step. The `transcripts.fa` file is published whenever the genome route runs (regardless of reference source), because the genome route otherwise has no single transcript FASTA to view the transcript-coordinate tracks against.

## RNA Framework

This pipeline uses modules from [RNA Framework](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### rf-count

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files: transcriptome route</summary>

- `count/rfcount_summary_all_samples.tsv`: Aggregated `rf-count` summary across all samples in the run (the per-sample summaries are merged into this single TSV for easy comparison between samples).
- `count/<sample>/`
  - `<sample>.rc`: Transcript-level raw per-position count file used as input to `rf-norm`.
  - `index.rci`: Index sidecar for the transcript-level count file.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files: genome route</summary>

- `count/<sample>/`
  - `<sample>.plus.rc` / `<sample>.minus.rc`: Genome-coordinate strand-specific raw count files.
  - `<sample>.rc`: Transcript-level count file extracted from genome coordinates via `rf-rctools extract`, used as input to `rf-norm`.
  - `<sample>.rc.rci`: Index sidecar for the transcript-level count file.
  - The aggregated `count/rfcount_summary_all_samples.tsv` (above) also covers genome-route samples.

</details>

[`rf-count`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-count/) calculates per-base RT-stop or mutation counts and read coverage from aligned reads. In most cases, the pipeline runs `rf-count` directly against transcript-coordinate BAM files provided by STAR or Bowtie. Optionally, it runs [`rf-count-genome`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-count-genome/) on the genome aligned BAM first, then converts genome-coordinate count files to transcript-level `.rc` files with `rf-rctools extract`.

The transcript-level `<sample>.rc` and `<sample>.rc.rci` files are passed to `rf-norm` for reactivity normalisation.

#### Example `rfcount_summary_all_samples.tsv`

The aggregated summary reports, per sample, the number of transcripts `covered` and the per-base composition of the counted events (`pct_a_muts`…`pct_u_muts`). The exact column set depends on the counting mode: MaP counts mismatches within each alignment, so it can report the overall mutated-alignment fraction (`mutated_alignments`, `pct_mutated`); RT-stop counts reverse-transcriptase drop-off positions rather than per-read mutations, so those two columns do not apply and are omitted. As a sanity check on the chemistry, in MaP runs `pct_mutated` should be higher in the treated samples than in the untreated controls. For DMS specifically (at pH < 8, where it modifies mainly A and C), `pct_a_muts` and `pct_c_muts` should dominate over `pct_g_muts` and `pct_u_muts`.

**MaP (mutational profiling) (SHAPE)**

| sample                       | covered | mutated_alignments   | pct_mutated | pct_a_muts | pct_c_muts | pct_g_muts | pct_u_muts |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| MDA-MB-231_DMSO_treated_r1   | 20241   | 106400534/151175161  | 70.38       | 19.59      | 21.41      | 26.94      | 32.06      |
| MDA-MB-231_DMSO_treated_r2   | 20508   | 109647170/159460915  | 68.76       | 19.83      | 20.65      | 27.11      | 32.42      |
| MDA-MB-231_DMSO_untreated_r1 | 24171   | 294831112/1121966212 | 26.28       | 20.30      | 29.69      | 28.89      | 21.11      |
| MDA-MB-231_DMSO_untreated_r2 | 24482   | 351733856/1409123432 | 24.96       | 20.84      | 25.96      | 30.87      | 22.33      |
| MDA-MB-231_MTX_treated_r1    | 20639   | 121944486/180812092  | 67.44       | 20.05      | 21.29      | 25.81      | 32.84      |
| MDA-MB-231_MTX_treated_r2    | 20473   | 108016250/155999073  | 69.24       | 20.27      | 20.68      | 26.33      | 32.71      |

This is close to an ideal result: the treated samples sit at ~67-70% `pct_mutated` against ~25% in the untreated controls, a clean ~3× separation that shows the probe reacted well above background.

**RT-stop (DMS)**

| sample                      | covered | pct_a_muts | pct_c_muts | pct_g_muts | pct_u_muts |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| L26_Delta_Rep1_100mM_DMS_r1 | 4278    | 48.48      | 12.43      | 17.03      | 22.06      |
| L26_Delta_Rep1_100mM_DMS_r2 | 4734    | 39.09      | 15.35      | 21.21      | 24.36      |
| L26_Delta_Rep1_NoDMS_r1     | 4369    | 32.74      | 15.94      | 20.74      | 30.58      |
| L26_Delta_Rep1_NoDMS_r2     | 5016    | 26.71      | 18.95      | 24.30      | 30.03      |
| Scer_WT_NoDMS_r1            | 4117    | 31.88      | 16.59      | 21.51      | 30.02      |
| Scer_WT_NoDMS_r2            | 5038    | 26.31      | 18.98      | 24.63      | 30.07      |
| WT_Rep1_100mM_DMS_r1        | 4223    | 47.23      | 12.81      | 18.34      | 21.62      |
| WT_Rep1_100mM_DMS_r2        | 4584    | 39.38      | 15.08      | 20.99      | 24.56      |

This example is less clear-cut. Lacking `pct_mutated` (see above), the base composition is the main handle: `pct_a_muts` does rise in the DMS-treated samples (~39-48% vs ~26-32% in the controls), but `pct_c_muts` is not elevated as DMS at pH < 8 would predict. Results like this warrant a closer look at the downstream reactivities before drawing conclusions.

### rf-normfactor (optional)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `norm/<reference>.norm_factors.txt`: Transcriptome-wide, cross-experiment normalisation factors for the reference, applied to every group's `rf-norm` via `-nf`.
- `norm/<reference>.rfnormfactor.log`: Raw `rf-normfactor` console output.

</details>

[`rf-normfactor`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-normfactor/) derives a single set of normalisation factors across all samples in a dataset aligned to the same reference so that reactivities are on a common scale for cross-sample comparison. This is auto-enabled for a reference with more than one treated sample. When it does not run, `rf-norm` normalises each group independently and no factor file is produced.

#### Example `<reference>.rfnormfactor.log`

The log records how many bases were covered across all of the reference's samples, how many of those were selected for normalisation, and the resulting per-sample factor that is passed to each treated group's `rf-norm` via `-nf`. Only treated samples receive a factor; untreated controls contribute to scoring but are not listed here.

```text
[+] Loading RC files...
[+] Calculating raw reactivities for bases covered across all samples... 810287 bases selected.
[+] Freeing unused memory...
[+] Selecting bases for normalization... 10700 selected.
[+] Normalization factors:

  [*] MDA-MB-231_DMSO_treated_r1: 0.0303267245741193
  [*] MDA-MB-231_DMSO_treated_r2: 0.0307702477985242
  [*] MDA-MB-231_MTX_treated_r1: 0.0274075148970783
  [*] MDA-MB-231_MTX_treated_r2: 0.0315441960095623

[+] All done.
```

The factors within a reference should be broadly comparable across samples; a sample with a wildly different factor is worth investigating.

### rf-norm

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `norm/<group>/`
  - `xml/<transcript>.xml`: Normalised reactivity profiles in RNA Framework XML format, used as input for `rf-fold` and optionally `rf-jackknife`.
  - `rfnorm.log`: Raw `rf-norm` console output.
  - `wiggle/<group>.wig`: Reactivity wiggle track for the group, produced by `rf-wiggle` over all of the group's normalised transcript XMLs. This is a single WIG file with one section per transcript (not one file per transcript).
- `norm/genome_bw/`
  - `<sample_group>_reactivity_genome.bw`: Genomic-coordinate reactivity BigWig. When multiple replicates are present the per-replicate transcript-level tracks are averaged position-by-position, remapped to genomic coordinates using the GTF, and converted to BigWig format.
- `norm/transcript_bw/`
  - `<sample_group>_reactivity_transcript.bw`: Transcript-coordinate reactivity BigWig. Same averaged reactivity data as `genome_bw/` but in transcript coordinates, suitable for visualisation alongside transcript-level annotations.

</details>

[`rf-norm`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-norm/) normalises raw RT-stop or MaP counts into per-nucleotide reactivity scores. Reactivity reflects each nucleotide's accessibility to the probe: high reactivity indicates an unpaired, flexible base, while low reactivity indicates a paired or structurally protected one. Output is grouped by `sample_group` + `replicate` (e.g. `HEK293T_1`). The XML files are the primary output passed to downstream structure-prediction steps. The BigWigs provide reactivity tracks (averaged across replicates where applicable) in both genomic and transcript coordinates for genome browser visualisation.

#### Example `rfnorm.log`

This log summarises how many transcripts were normalised and why others were dropped:

```text
[+] Normalization statistics:

  [*] Covered transcripts:   2264
  [*] Discarded transcripts: 30203 total
                             30203 insufficient coverage
                             0 mismatch between treated and untreated sample sequence
                             0 absent in untreated sample reference

[+] All done.
```

Most transcripts are typically discarded for insufficient coverage; the mismatch and absent-in-untreated counts should stay at or near zero, as non-zero values there point to a reference or sample-pairing problem rather than shallow coverage.

The reactivity BigWigs (`norm/{genome,transcript}_bw/`) can be loaded into a genome browser such as IGV; see [Viewing tracks in a genome browser](#viewing-tracks-in-a-genome-browser) for which reference to load per route, example figures, and interpretation caveats.

### rf-correlate (replicate QC)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `correlate/<group>.pearson_correlate/` and `correlate/<group>.spearman_correlate/`
  - `matrix.csv`: Overall pairwise correlation matrix between the group's replicates.
  - `pairwise/<repA>_vs_<repB>.tsv`: Per-transcript correlation coefficients and p-values for each replicate pair.
- `correlate/<group>.{pearson,spearman}.rfcorrelate.log`: Raw `rf-correlate` console output for each method.

</details>

[`rf-correlate`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-correlate/) quantifies replicate reproducibility by correlating reactivity profiles between the replicates of a sample group (transcriptome-wide and per-transcript). It runs for groups with more than one replicate (controlled by `--correlate_replicates`) and computes both **Pearson** (reactivity-capped) and **Spearman** (rank-based) correlations, published to separate `.pearson`/`.spearman` directories. The overall pairwise correlations are also summarised in the MultiQC report as a per-sample-group table (number of replicates, mean Pearson and mean Spearman correlation), giving an at-a-glance reproducibility check.

#### Example `rfcorrelate.log`

Each log reports how many transcripts were shared across the group's replicates, the pairwise correlation, and how many transcripts had enough paired positions to be correlated:

```text
[+] Importing input XML directories/files... 2144 common transcripts.
[+] Calculating pairwise correlations...

[+] Pairwise correlations (over 855878 bases):

  Sample #1    Sample #2    Correlation    p-value

  rep1_1       rep2_2       0.765          0.00e+00

[+] Correlation statistics:

  [*] Correlated transcripts/blocks: 2141
  [*] Discarded transcripts/blocks:  3 total
                                     0 parsing failed
                                     0 mismatch between transcript sequences
                                     3 not enough values for correlation calculation

[+] All done.
```

The headline number is the pairwise correlation (here Pearson 0.765 between the two DMSO replicates); higher means more reproducible reactivity profiles, and it is the value carried into the MultiQC table. Discards are almost always transcripts with too few paired positions to correlate; non-zero `parsing failed` or `mismatch between transcript sequences` counts instead indicate a reference or input problem.

### rf-fold

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fold/<group>/`
  - `structures/r2dt/<transcript>.svg`: Template-based 2D structure diagram drawn by R2DT, when a matching template is available.
  - `structures/viennarna/<transcript>.svg`: RNAplot 2D structure diagram drawn by ViennaRNA.
  - `structures/r2dt.log`: log of transcripts drawn/skipped by R2DT.
  - `rdat/<transcript>.rdat`: RDAT-format file (compatible with RMDB) which summarises results (sequence, dot-bracket notation, reactivities) and key parameters for how it was produced.
  - `rffold.log`: Raw `rf-fold` console output.
- `fold/genome_bp/`
  - `<sample_group>_genome.bp`: Base-pair arcs merged into a single file per sample group in genome coordinates, suitable for arc diagram visualisation in a genome browser such as IGV.
- `fold/transcript_bp/`
  - `<sample_group>_transcript.bp`: Same base-pair arcs in transcript coordinates (transcript ID as chromosome, 1-based transcript positions). Suitable for visualisation against a transcript-level reference in IGV.
- `fold/shannon_genome_bw/`
  - `<sample_group>_shannon_genome.bw`: Genomic-coordinate per-position Shannon entropy BigWig across the transcript ensemble for a sample group.
- `fold/shannon_transcript_bw/`
  - `<sample_group>_shannon_transcript.bw`: Transcript-coordinate Shannon entropy BigWig, equivalent to `shannon_genome_bw/` but in transcript coordinates.

</details>

[`rf-fold`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-fold/) predicts RNA secondary structures from normalised reactivity profiles. Replicates for the same sample group are combined and folded together using ViennaRNA RNAfold in a windowed manner, which improves accuracy for long transcripts by folding overlapping sequence windows and merging the results. Key outputs per transcript include 2D structure diagrams, [RDAT](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/deposit/specs/) files summarising the predicted structure and reactivity values. Genome-wide Shannon entropy profiles and base-pair arcs are additionally provided as BigWig and `.bp` tracks for visualisation in a genome browser, in both genome and transcript coordinates. Shannon entropy measures the uncertainty of the predicted base-pairing at each position: lower entropy means the structure ensemble agrees on a single conformation (a higher-confidence prediction), while higher entropy indicates several competing folds.

The two renderers run independently in parallel, so a transcript with an R2DT template gets both diagrams:

- **[ViennaRNA](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/)**: draws every transcript. `RNAplot` produces an energy-minimised 2D diagram from the dot-bracket structure. Published to `fold/<group>/structures/viennarna/`.
- **[R2DT](https://github.com/RNAcentral/R2DT)**: additionally draws transcripts with a matching template in the R2DT library (rRNA, snRNA, tRNA, etc.), producing layouts comparable across organisms. Enabled with `--r2dt`. Published to `fold/<group>/structures/r2dt/`.

#### Example structure diagram

R2DT lays the predicted structure onto a standard template so diagrams are comparable across samples and organisms. The example below is the _E. coli_ 16S rRNA (`fold/E_coli_DH5a_ex_vivo/structures/r2dt/16S.svg`), matched to the R2DT small-subunit rRNA template:

![E. coli 16S rRNA secondary structure drawn by R2DT](images-for-output/ecoli-16s-r2dt.svg)

ViennaRNA `RNAplot` draws the same predicted structure with an energy-minimised layout rather than a standard template. Because both renderers run, a transcript like 16S is drawn both ways: here is the same _E. coli_ 16S rRNA drawn by ViennaRNA (`fold/E_coli_DH5a_ex_vivo/structures/viennarna/16S.svg`):

![E. coli 16S rRNA secondary structure drawn by ViennaRNA](images-for-output/ecoli-16s-viennarna.svg)

#### Example `.rdat` file

The per-transcript RDAT file bundles the sequence, the predicted structure, and the reactivity data behind these diagrams into one [RMDB-compatible](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/deposit/specs/) record. Below is the _E. coli_ 16S rRNA RDAT with the long sequence/structure/reactivity lines abbreviated:

The fields are: `NAME` (transcript ID), `SEQUENCE`, `STRUCTURE` (predicted structure in dot-bracket notation), `ANNOTATION_DATA` (the probe used, here DMS), `REACTIVITY` (per-nucleotide normalised reactivity, `NaN` where there was no usable signal), and `COMMENT` (provenance: pipeline version, reference FASTA, probing principle, and the `rf-norm` scoring/normalisation methods used to produce the values).

### Viewing tracks in a genome browser

The reactivity and Shannon-entropy BigWigs (`norm/{genome,transcript}_bw/`, `fold/shannon_{genome,transcript}_bw/`) load into IGV or UCSC against the matching reference:

- **Genome-coordinate tracks** (`*_genome.bw`, `fold/genome_bp/`): load against the genome FASTA + GTF. On the transcriptome route these are not produced; use the genome route if you want a genomic view.
- **Transcript-coordinate tracks** (`*_transcript.bw`, `fold/transcript_bp/`): load the transcript FASTA as the browser's reference sequence: the transcriptome route's `<organism>.sorted.fa` (the cDNA FASTA), or `reference/<reference>.transcripts.fa` on the default (`count_genome = false`) genome route. Each transcript appears as its own "chromosome", so the per-nucleotide profile is continuous.

#### Genome tracks superpose isoforms; prefer transcript coordinates for structure

Genome-coordinate tracks project every transcript onto the assembly and **average** overlapping positions, so at a multi-isoform locus (e.g. human `HLA-A` and the rest of the MHC) the track is a _superposition_ of all isoforms, not the profile of any single transcript. This matters differently for the two kinds of data:

- **Reactivity** is a per-nucleotide experimental measurement, so its genome projection is meaningful: it shows where the RNA was modified, and gaps mark introns or uncovered positions. It only writes covered positions, so introns of a given transcript stay empty unless another isoform genuinely has a covered exon there.
- **Shannon entropy and base-pair arcs** describe the fold of a _whole_ transcript, not a genomic position, and are defined at every folded nucleotide (no coverage gaps). Projected to the genome and averaged across isoforms, they blend distinct structural models: one isoform's introns get filled by another isoform's exons, so the track looks continuous across the locus. This is expected, not a bug, but it is not "the structure" of any one transcript.

For accurate interpretation, prefer the **transcript-coordinate** tracks against the transcript FASTA, where each transcript is its own "chromosome" with no cross-isoform blending. The **genome-coordinate** tracks are best used to visualise reactivity profiles in the context of the surrounding transcripts/locus, rather than as a per-transcript structural readout. On single-isoform genes (and all prokaryotic references, which are unspliced) the genome and transcript views are equivalent and this caveat does not apply.

#### Example figures

All figures below are from the human `HLA-A` gene (SHAPE, MDA-MB-231).

**All tracks together (transcript coordinates).** Reactivity, Shannon entropy, and base-pair arcs for a single transcript (`ENST00000638375`, DMSO), loaded against the transcript FASTA. This is the cleanest way to read a single transcript's data: every track shares the same continuous per-nucleotide axis:

![HLA-A reactivity, Shannon and base-pair tracks in transcript coordinates](images-for-output/hla-a_all_tracks_transcript.png)

**Reactivity in genome coordinates** (`norm/genome_bw/<group>_reactivity_genome.bw`). Signal follows the exon structure of the gene model, with introns appearing as gaps; the genome view is meaningful for reactivity because it is a per-nucleotide measurement:

![HLA-A reactivity in genomic coordinates](images-for-output/hla-a_reactivity_genome.png)

For **structure**, the genome view is less useful at a multi-isoform locus like HLA-A. In the base-pair arc tracks, each arc connects two paired bases, coloured by base-pair probability: **yellow** = 10-40%, **blue** = 40-70%, **green** = 70-100% (pairs below 10% are not drawn; `rf-fold`'s dot-plot conversion runs with `--min-color-index 1`).

Genome-coordinate base-pair arcs (`fold/genome_bp/<group>_genome.bp`): base pairs from every folded isoform are projected onto the assembly and overlap into a dense tangle:

![HLA-A base-pair arcs in genomic coordinates](images-for-output/hla-a_bp_genome.png)

Transcript-coordinate base-pair arcs (`fold/transcript_bp/<group>_transcript.bp`): the same data for one transcript, showing clean nested arcs:

![HLA-A base-pair arcs in transcript coordinates](images-for-output/hla-a_bp_transcript.png)

The Shannon-entropy tracks (`fold/shannon_{genome,transcript}_bw/`) behave the same way: clean per transcript, superposed in genome coordinates.

### rf-structextract (optional)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fold/<group>/extracted_structures/dotbracket/*.db`: Extracted structural motifs for the sample group in dot-bracket notation (one multi-record file per transcript, each record named `<transcript>_<start>-<end>`), filtered to high-confidence, low-reactivity / low-Shannon elements meeting the configured criteria.
- `fold/<group>/extracted_structures/images/*_ss.svg`: One 2D diagram per extracted motif, drawn with ViennaRNA RNAplot and coloured by SHAPE reactivity in the same style as the rf-fold structure plots.

</details>

[`rf-structextract`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-structextract/) extracts well-defined structural elements from the rf-fold output by combining the predicted structures with per-base reactivity and Shannon entropy. Only runs when `--structextract` is set (see [usage docs](usage.md) for the selection-criteria parameters). It identifies substructures whose bases are consistently below the transcript median for both reactivity and Shannon entropy, which is the signature of stably folded regions.

#### Example extracted motif

This is where `rf-structextract` earns its place: it pulls the few genuinely well-defined structural elements out of a large transcript, where the full-length fold is mostly low-confidence and hard to read. The human transcript `ENST00000942651` (2,173 nt, `MDA-MB-231_DMSO` group) is a good example: its full rf-fold ViennaRNA diagram (`fold/MDA-MB-231_DMSO/structures/viennarna/ENST00000942651.svg`) is a dense, largely uninformative hairball:

![Full ENST00000942651 structure drawn by ViennaRNA](images-for-output/enst00000942651-viennarna.svg)

From this, `rf-structextract` isolates one region, positions 646-750, whose bases pass the reactivity and Shannon-entropy tests, a well-defined 105 nt motif that would otherwise be lost in the full-length diagram. It is written to the multi-record dot-bracket file (`extracted_structures/dotbracket/ENST00000942651.db`, record `ENST00000942651_646-750`) and drawn on its own, reactivity-coloured, in `extracted_structures/images/ENST00000942651_646-750_ss.svg`:

![Extracted ENST00000942651 motif, positions 646-750](images-for-output/enst00000942651-motif-646-750.svg)

### rf-jackknife (optional)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `jackknife/all_groups_jackknife/` (the default pooled run; with `--rfjackknife_pool_all false` you instead get one `jackknife/<group>_jackknife/` per sample group)
  - `mFMI.csv`: Grid-search scores as a semicolon-delimited matrix. Rows are slope values, columns are intercept values, and each cell is the mean modified Fowlkes-Mallows Index (mFMI) between the reference structures and the structure rf-fold predicts at that slope/intercept.
  - `rfjackknife.log`: Raw `rf-jackknife` console output, including the ranked top slope/intercept pairs and the jackknifing statistics.

</details>

[`rf-jackknife`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-jackknife/) identifies optimal slope and intercept parameters for reactivity-guided structure folding by performing a grid search and comparing predicted structures to a set of reference structures using the (modified) Fowlkes-Mallows Index.

This step only runs when `--jackknife_reference` is provided.

#### Example `mFMI.csv` and log

Below is a bacterial calibration (`jackknife/all_groups_jackknife/`, DMS-MaP scored against two reference structures, 16S and 23S rRNA). Rows are slopes, columns are intercepts, and higher mFMI is better; the scores climb towards the high-slope, low-magnitude-intercept corner (columns abbreviated):

```text
mFMI;-3;-2.8;…;-1.6;-1.4;…;-0.2
0;0.483;0.484;…;0.567;0.573;…;0.654
2.2;0.691;0.734;…;0.810;0.820;…;0.840
4.4;0.817;0.819;…;0.859;0.867;…;0.826
4.8;0.818;0.831;…;0.867;0.859;…;0.829
```

`rf-jackknife` ranks the best pairs and reports how many transcripts contributed in the log:

```text
[+] Top slope/intercept value pairs:

  Slope    Intercept    mFMI

  4.4      -1.4         0.867
  4.8      -1.6         0.867
  4.6      -1.4         0.866
  4.6      -1.6         0.864
  3.4      -1.2         0.860

[+] Jackknifing statistics:

  [*] Used transcripts:     2
  [*] Excluded transcripts: 0 total
```

Here the optimal pair is slope `4.4` / intercept `-1.4` (mFMI `0.867`). mFMI runs from 0 to 1, where around `0.5` is no better than chance and higher means closer agreement with the reference structures; as a rough guide a best value above `0.7` indicates a genuinely well-calibrated fold, so `0.867` here is a strong result. When jackknife runs, these calibrated values take priority over the `--rffold_slope`/`--rffold_intercept` flags and the chemical-based defaults, and are passed on to rf-fold (unless `--stop_after_jackknife` is set).

### rf-eval (optional)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `eval/<group>_rfeval/`
  - `rfeval.log`: Raw `rf-eval` console output. The evaluation metrics (Unpaired Coefficient, DSCI, and AUROC) are reported here in the "Overall metrics" block; this log is currently the only published output of the step.

</details>

[`rf-eval`](https://rnaframework-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rf-eval/) evaluates how well normalised reactivity profiles agree with a set of reference structures. It reports three metrics, each running from 0 to 1, where around `0.5` is chance-level (a reactivity profile with no relationship to the known structure) and higher means better agreement:

- **Unpaired Coefficient**: fraction of highly reactive bases that are unpaired
- **DSCI**: probability that a randomly selected unpaired base has higher reactivity than a paired base
- **AUROC**: area under the ROC curve treating reactivity as a classifier of unpaired bases

This step only runs when `--rfeval_reference` is provided.

#### Example metrics

Below is the "Overall metrics" block from `rfeval.log` for one of the bacterial _E. coli_ sample groups, evaluated against the reference 16S and 23S rRNA structures:

```text
[i] Successfully evaluated 1 structure(s)
[i] Overall metrics:

  [*] Coefficient unpaired: 0.816
  [*] DSCI:                 0.871
  [*] AUC:                  0.873
```

All three metrics sit at 0.82-0.87 here, comfortably above the ~0.5 chance level, so the DMS reactivities agree well with the reference rRNA structure.

## MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: MultiQC report aggregating QC metrics across all samples.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) aggregates results from all pipeline tools into a single report. Alongside the standard modules (FastQC read quality, Cutadapt trimming, Bowtie/Bowtie2/STAR alignment rates, and SAMtools flagstat/idxstats/stats), the pipeline adds custom summary tables that follow the samples through the RNA Framework steps. The screenshots below are from the human dataset (MDA-MB-231, DMS-MaP).

#### General Statistics

The standard MultiQC table, aggregating key per-sample metrics (read counts, duplication, GC, trimming, and alignment rate) across the QC modules:

![MultiQC General Statistics table](images-for-output/multiqc-general-stats.png)

#### Count Progression

Per sample: reads mapped before and after deduplication, the fraction removed, and the number of transcripts `rf-count` covered. With the default `--skip_markdup true` (no UMIs) nothing is deduplicated, so "Removed by Dedup" is `0.0%`.

![MultiQC Count Progression table](images-for-output/multiqc-count-progression.png)

#### RF-norm Statistics

Per `sample_group` + replicate: how many of the covered transcripts pass `rf-norm`'s coverage filter ("Good Coverage"). The steep drop from ~20,000 covered transcripts to a few thousand well-covered ones is expected; only transcripts with enough per-base signal are worth normalising and folding.

![MultiQC RF-norm Statistics table](images-for-output/multiqc-rfnorm-stats.png)

#### RF-fold Statistics

Per `sample_group`: transcripts folded by `rf-fold` versus those discarded (too short, or without enough reactivity coverage to fold).

![MultiQC RF-fold Statistics table](images-for-output/multiqc-rffold-stats.png)

#### Replicate Correlation

Per `sample_group`: the replicate count and the mean pairwise Pearson and Spearman reactivity correlation, an at-a-glance reproducibility check. See [rf-correlate](#rf-correlate) for the per-replicate logs these are summarised from.
